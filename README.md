## Running 
- Clone the repository
- Update `SCALA_HOME` and `SPARK_HOME` in the `Makefile`
- create a folder data and place the input files
- Update variable INPUT_SONGS_FILE_PATH=the path of song_info.csv in your system
- Update variable INPUT_ARTIST_TERMS_FILE_PATH= the path of artist_terms.csv in your system
- Verify `SPARK_CLASS_PATH` (For some installations the lib path is `libexec/jars/*`)
- `make` this will clean, build, run the program and generate the report

## Requirements
- Scala - used version `2.11.11`. *NOTE* using `2.12.4` results in error (`java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/runtime/LambdaDeserialize`)
- Apache Spark - used version `spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7`

- driver memory and executor memory have been set to 2 GB on the local system on which the program was run, one can run with any configuration but this could affect the time taken to get the desired output
