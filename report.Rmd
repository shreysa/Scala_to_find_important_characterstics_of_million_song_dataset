### Summary of the design of evaluated program

The implementation involves reading the data and putting it in SparkContext. We have created a class CleanUp which does the clean up validuty checks on the provided data and returns the desired column value. We have written a simple CheckValidity method in CleanUp class where we have put all the validity checks as per our assumptions below. The SongAnalysis object is the entry point to the program that taken in song_info.csv and artist_terms.csv locations as arguments and calls the methods in the CleanUp class to get the desired output.  

## Data Analysis

####Assumptions

For loudness of song, the closer the loudness score to 0 in negative, the louder the song. If value is 0, then it is an invalid entry. We have taken the Song Id, Song Name and Loudness score combination to represent the loudness score. This combination is unique. So if there is a song with same id and same name but different loudness score or any of the other combinations it would appear as a distinct entry in the list.

For longness of song, the duration should be greater than 0, the larger the value, longer is the song. We have taken the Song Id, Song Name and duration combination to represent the longest songs. This combination is unique.

For fastness of song, the larger the value of tempo, the faster is the song. We have taken the Song Id, Song Name and tempo score combination to represent the how fast the song is. This combination is unique. 


For artist familiarity, the higher the value from 0, the more is the score. If value is 0 or less than 0, record is invalid
We have taken artist name, artist id and artist familiarity score combination to represent the artist familiarity. This combination is unique. So if there is an artist with same id but different name and different familiarity score or any of the other combinations it would appear as a distinct entry in the list.

For song hottness and artist hottness the values should be between 0 and 1. Any value less than 0 or greater than 1 is invalid.
We have taken song id or artist id, song name or artist name and song hotness or artist hotness score combination to represent the song hotness and artist hotness respectively. This combination is unique. So if there is an artist or a song with same id but different name or different hotness score or any of the other combinations it would appear as a distinct entry in the list.

### Performance Analysis

#### Table 1: Time taken for 10 runs on small dataset

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
spark_run_local<-read.csv("output/spark_run.csv")
knitr::kable(spark_run_local)
```

The above table represents the total time taken and total average time of 10 runs of Scala job in seconds. Each run takes about 8.6 seconds to finish. These values are for the subset on the assignment page on the local machine.

##### Plot 1: Total time in seconds vs Run for the subset

```{r}
ggplot(spark_run_local, aes(x=Run, y=total_time, color="Total Time")) + 
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Total Time in seconds") + 
  xlab("Run") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(7,11,1), limits = c(7, 11)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,10,1), limits = c(1,10))
```

Plot 1 represents the graph for the data shown in table 1. This represents the total time taken by each run in seconds on the small dataset. It can be seen from the graph that the values range between 5 to 7 seconds averaging out to 5.9 seconds for 10 runs.

#### Table 2: Time taken for 10 runs on complete dataset

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
spark_run_local_big<-read.csv("output/spark_run_big.csv")
knitr::kable(spark_run_local_big)
```

Table 2 represents the total time taken and total average time of 10 runs of Scala job in seconds for the complete dataset. Each run takes about 306.8 seconds to finish. It is noticed that all the requirements but "top 5 hottest genres (mean artists hotness in artist_term)" finish in about 80 seconds, however the query mentioned involves a join and hence takes the majority of the time.

##### Plot 2: Total time in seconds vs Run for the big dataset

```{r}
ggplot(spark_run_local_big, aes(x=Run, y=total_time, color="Total Time")) + 
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Total Time in seconds") + 
  xlab("Run") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(304,310, 1), limits = c(304, 310)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,10,1), limits = c(1,10))
```

Plot 2 represents the graph for the data shown in table 2. This represnts the total time taken by each run in seconds on the complete dataset. It can be seen from the graph that the values range between 305 to 308 seconds averaging out to 306.8 seconds for 10 runs.

### Conclusion

The program analysis some features of the Million song dataset. It was observed that if scala is picking up features from the same file, it runs fairly fast however while joining data points from 2 seperate files makes the program run very very slow. All the requirements but "top 5 hottest genres (mean artists hotness in artist_term)" finish in about 70 seconds but the one mentioned takes about 236 seconds alone. Also, we cleaned up the data before doing any analysis, hence the number of records in each requirement appear to be less than it should have been. Instead we could have put individual cheacks on columns before we analysed them. That would have given greater counts.
